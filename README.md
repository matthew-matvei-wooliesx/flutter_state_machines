# flutter_state_machines

This project explores ways to simplify state-based business and view logic.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter. Either:
    * the [Flutter SDK itself](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) if this experience with Flutter will be a
        one off, or
    * [Flutter Version Manager](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation/) if you'll ever use Flutter in
        multiple projects
1. From the root directory, run:

    ```sh
    # If you installed the Flutter SDK itself
    flutter test

    # Or if you want to use FVM to manage the Flutter SDK
    fvm flutter test
    ```
1. Provided the tests all pass, feel free to run this locally by doing:

    ```sh
    # As above
    flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html

    # Or if using FVM as above
    fvm flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html
    ```

    Of course you can run this app with a different target device by changing the `-d` argument. See
    `flutter run --help` for more help.

If anything from the above doesn't work for you, please reach out.
